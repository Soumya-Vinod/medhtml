           <b>INTERACTION WITH MEDICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS:</b> 
           <br><br>
            <li>
                While hospitals will try to ensure a confirmed appointment with a medical service provider (like a doctor ) for
                a user who requested an appointment on the website, hospitals do not guarantee that the user will get a confirmed appointment. 
                Further, Hospital has no liability if such an appointment is later canceled, postponed, or rescheduled by the medical service provider, 
                or if the medical service provider is not available as per the given appointment time. If you decide to engage with a medical service 
                provider to provide medical services to you, you do so at your own risk.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hospital may provide value-added services that connect the user directly to the medical service providers via video call, 
                voice call, text message, online chat, or other electronic means and the information exchanged is stored and used by the Privacy Policy. 
                However, it is at the discretion of the user, to avail of such service if it is available.
            </li>
        <br>

    <ul>
    
            <b>ONLINE PAYMENT ON THE WEBSITE:</b>

            <li>
                The website provides you the ability to pay online through a third-party payment for some of the services available on the website.
                If you choose to pay online, you may be directed to a third-party payment gateway to enable the processing of the payment.
            </li>
            <li>
                The cancellation and refund policy applies to all online payments made through the website and will be governed by the third-party payment
                gateway and no responsibility in that regard lies with the Hospital. At the time of cancellation, the amount will be refunded via the same 
                source of payment and will be subject to the payment terms of the source only and will be refunded within a given number of working days
                communicated by the third-party payment gateway.
